# Java Command-Line Tool

## Project Overview

The Java  Command-Line Tool is a versatile utility designed to perform specific tasks efficiently through command-line interactions. It offers functionalities such as file compression, text manipulation, file encryption/decryption, and image processing, providing users with flexibility and automation capabilities.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of our command-line utility is to offer users a convenient and efficient tool without the need for a graphical user interface (GUI). This enhances flexibility, automation capabilities, and ease of use for users who prefer command-line interactions.

## Project Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Command-Line Argument Handling:** argparse module
- **Encryption Library:** Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA)
- **Compression Libraries:** GZIP or ZIP libraries
- **Image Processing Library:** Java Advanced Imaging (JAI)

## Project Features

1. **File Compression:** Supports file compression using GZIP or ZIP algorithms.
2. **Text Manipulation:** Offers functionalities for string search and replace, text extraction, and formatting options.
3. **File Encryption/Decryption:** Integrates encryption and decryption using AES for securing sensitive files with passwords.
4. **Image Processing:** Includes functionalities like resizing, format conversion, and applying filters/effects to images.

## Project Setup

1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK) on your system.
2. Clone the project repository from GitHub using the provided URL.
